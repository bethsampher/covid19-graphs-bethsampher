# Python code compliance

## Instructions

This must be assessed by the pycodestyle and pylint tools. 
Please note your code must conform to the 79 characters line length limit. 
You must use the `pycodestyle` and `pylint` tools and include the output for 
all python code in this file `README_PEP8.md`. 

pycodestyle should not produce any warnings.

It is acceptable to have pylint warnings (for instance missing docstrings for unit tests)
 provided they are justified in README_PEP8.md..
